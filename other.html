                <h3>Learning for the Future</h3>
                <div class="thought-date">08.20.2025</div>
                <p>
                    With the rise of AI, we should probably lean away from take home problem sets and essays that students turn in and aren't responsible for again. 
                    My thought is that we should enter an "accountability" era in learning, where students create something then are responsible for that output.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For example, have a student write an essay (that, yes, can be ChatGPT-able) but then have them defend that essay or position in class. 
                    Start mini-dissertations earlier in a school career. 
                    In our tech strategy class, we used an AI to debate against us AHEAD of class, and then we defended our positions in class with other students. 
                    I liked this model of AI prep then real world discussion. I know you can't do this for every class (how do we defend points in math class...? do we have people defend their proofs?) but I think this is a possible model for the school future. 
                    Most importantly, it teaches students to be accountable for their work and to think critically about their own ideas. 
                    Accountability is a key skill in the real world, and critically thinking will prevent brain-rot that seems to be widespread with the rise of AI.

                <p>Here are some insights I learned from my first M&A class that I think are generally applicable in life and business:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The only bad risk is uncomponsated risk</li>
                    <li>If you can't model it on a napkin (or architect it / summarize it in a simple way), it's probably not worth pursuing</li>
                    <li>Never walk into a deal without knowing who could become rich from it</li>
