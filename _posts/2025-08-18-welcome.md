# Welcome to My Blog

I'm excited to launch this new space where I'll be sharing my thoughts on topics I'm passionate about. You'll find blogs on tech, economics, and more.

## What You Can Expect

I've had the opportunity to work across different industries - from startups to consulting to big tech - and I try and use this experience to simplify complicated topics and bridge the gap between technical and non-technical people. 

Additionally, I've spent some time as a group fitness instructor and a LOT of time watching sports, so every now I'll write about those topics as well. Go Hoosiers.
