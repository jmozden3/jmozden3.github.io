excerpt: "Shoot for the moon. Even if you miss, you'll land among the stars"

When Dr. Otto Octavius said "the power of the sun in the palm of my hand" he was really onto something. Beside Spiderman 2 being a total kick ass movie, it's a nice reminder of something we often forget: we have the ultimate energy source - the sun - _right_ there for the taking.

Now picture this...a vast shell of solar 'collectors'...little solar panels surrounding our sun ,caputring every single photon of its energy output and completely encompassing the star. This is a Dyson Sphere - humanity's ultimate energy infrastructure. 

I am totally fascinated by Dyson spheres. They're just so cool to think about. The scale is almost incomprehensible to imagine...in just a second, a Dyson sphere could harvest more power than humanity has consumed throughout all of history. More energy we've ever needed to cleanly power every computer, every city, fuel every journey amongst our galaxy and beyond. We could reverse climate change, terraform Mars and Venus, and finally become an internsteller species. The limits are, literally, endless.

Impossible? Perhaps. But, to me, that is the point. 

## Ingenuity is Humanity's Engine

Kennedy once told us that we would go to the moon. That seemed impossible, but we did it. And along the way, the journey to put a man on the moon helped create the technology pivotal to smartphones. Star Trek helped inspire generations of kids on what a truly technological-first universe could look like. Fiction can often act as the blueprint for our reality.

The reason I love Dyson Spheres so much isn't because I think it's plausible (at least in our lifetime) but because of how wonderful it is to think of an abundant world driven by our ingenuity and technology. Instead of asking how we use less, we should focus on creating more. This is the 'Upwing mentality' that I think we need to adopt - thinking so big so that we make big change. 

## Stepping Stones

And you know what's cool about all this? We don't even need a Dyson Sphere to achieve ultimate energy abundance. A (legitimately achievable, with the right focus) step down is a Dyson Swarm; instead of completely encompassing the sun, we just send a "swarm" of millions (or billions!) of independent solar collectors orbiting the sun. This offers the same level of energy harvesting in a much more feasible manner. Here is a [good explainer](https://youtu.be/pP44EPBMb8A?si=WIPTkJ2bYMCbfCnn) on how we would do it. 

Oh, and what's even cooler than _THAT_? We've made incredible improvements in renewable energy that brings us ever so closer to an clean energy abundant future. Solar panel efficiency has been hitting efficiency record after efficiency record. Battery storage is revolutionizing the grid. Space launch costs have dropped dramatically. It has become more economically feasible than ever to use renewable energy than fossil fuels. 

All of these improvements compound towards the bigger vision. Better solar panels build momentum for a renewable, upwing future. Cheaper launches make space exploration more affordable. Better manufacturing enables space-infrastructure. Advanced batteries enable storage at any scale we need.

## Being Upwing 

Upwing thinking - a  philosophy embracing technological progress and innovation for a more abundant future - uses grand visions to fuel practical progress. Big dreams create urgency for progress. 

This is progress we can _achieve_. **We ABSOLUTELY CAN achieve energy abundance in our lifetimes** - maybe not through a Dyson sphere or swarm, but maybe through fission, fusion, nuclear or hyper efficient solar / battery / renwable infrastructure. This is a future that can solve many of our hardest problems and provide an abundant life for all. By thinking and dreaming big, like how we can caputure all the energy of our nearest star, we can push our race to achieve impossible things and beyond.
